mfcd - The Macbook Air fan Control Daemon
===
mfcd is a Linux fan control daemon written for the Macbook Air (though it may
work for other models, I haven't tested it). I wrote it because I found
macfanctld too be much too bloated, taking up 19184 bytes of storage, 224kb of
RAM and frequently hitting 1% CPU usage. mfcd on the other hand never hits 1%
CPU usage, uses only <872 bytes of storage space and a measly 8kb of RAM. Granted
it doesn't have all of macfanctld's bells and whistles, but I just didn't need
them anyways.
